- Key Metrics Summary:
Despite a significant increase in sales turnover (82.82% vs the previous year) and COGS (85.9% vs the previous year), profit has declined by 19.4%, and the profit margin has dropped by 55.91%. This suggests that rising costs are outpacing revenue growth, which negatively impacts profitability. Peak spike months are seen in August, May, September and November, while major fall happens in June and October.
